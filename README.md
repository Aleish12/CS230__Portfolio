# CS230 Portfolio

This repository contains my final portfolio submission for CS230 - Software Design.  
It includes:
- The completed Software Design Document for *The Gaming Room*.
- A reflective journal entry answering the required questions.

## Journal Entry

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room. They wanted the design for a multiplayer game application that could run across different platforms and support many users at the same time. The key needs were scalability, reliable performance, secure access, and efficient use of resources so the system would stay responsive as the player base grows. They also needed clear separation of components so the system would be easier to maintain and extend.


### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think one of my strengths was explaining technical concepts in a way that was clear and organized. I made sure the document connected directly to the project requirements instead of just listing facts. I also put effort into comparing the different platforms fairly and highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Writing the design document gave me a roadmap before starting any coding. It helped me think about memory, storage, and security issues ahead of time so that I didn’t run into as many surprises later. Having everything laid out kept me focused and made development less overwhelming.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had the chance, I would revise the part about distributed systems. I feel like I could go deeper into scalability and performance. Adding a simple diagram or example would make that section easier to understand and more useful.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design?
I kept the user’s needs in mind by focusing on what they asked for: reliability, security, and cross-platform access. That’s why I compared multiple operating systems and explained why Linux would be the best choice for hosting. I also considered security from the start since that was an important need for the client.

### Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Because at the end of the day, the design isn’t for me it’s for the client. If I don’t design with the user’s needs in mind, the solution may work technically but won’t actually help them. Taking their needs seriously makes the project meaningful and ensures that the software will be useful.

### How did you approach designing software?
My approach was to take it step by step. First, I broke down the requirements and made sure I understood the problem. Then I compared different options before deciding what would work best. I tried to focus on modularity and security so that the design would be strong and easier to maintain. Reviewing and adjusting along the way helped me stay on track.
